# Person A — Deliverables Handoff

## Mini-RAG Retrieval Evaluation

This document summarizes the artifacts produced by **Person A** and how they should be used by **Person B** and **Person C** for the remainder of the project.

---

## Deliverables Summary

| Deliverable | Purpose | Used By |
|---|---|---|
| `eval_dataset.json` | 50 evaluation questions with gold chunks | Person B & C |
| `run_metrics.py` | Runs retrieval evaluation and computes metrics | Person A |
| `results.csv` | Per-query metric results | Person B |
| `summary.txt` | Overall evaluation statistics | Person B & C |
| `plots/` | Metric visualizations | Person B & C |

---

## Status

✅ **Person A responsibilities are complete.**

All outputs listed above are finalized and ready for handoff. These artifacts are exactly what Persons B and C need for the remainder of the project:

- **Person B** — uses `eval_dataset.json`, `results.csv`, `summary.txt`, and `plots/` for the Google Spreadsheet, metric analysis, graph interpretation, project report, and final presentation.
- **Person C** — uses `results.csv`, `summary.txt`, and `plots/` for final documentation, performance discussion, future improvements, and the final demonstration.

## Handoff Note

No changes to the existing Mini-RAG retrieval pipeline were made. This evaluation layer can be run independently at any time via:

```bash
python evaluations/run_metrics.py
```
